## Key Highlights:
- 6,000+ real individuals (not synthetic/AI-generated)
- 10-15 images per person - maximum training diversity
- Archive selfies divided into "old" (5+ years) and "recent" (&lt; 5 years) subfolders for age-invariant face recognition
- Selfies + Official ID Photos - unique combination for identity verification
- Balanced demographics - ages 18-65
- Multi-ethnic coverage - Caucasian, Black, Asian, Latin American
- Real-world conditions - diverse backgrounds, lighting, expressions

## Dataset includes&nbsp;metadata (meta_public.json)&nbsp;with detailed information for each participant:&nbsp;
- Demographics:&nbsp;gender, ethnicity, birth_year 
- Device info:&nbsp;os (Android/iOS/Windows), device type, model 
- Temporal data:&nbsp;archive_selfie_year for each archive photo (e.g., "2018", "2020", "2024") 
- Lighting categories (current selfies only): indoor_lights_selfie (artificial lighting), indoor_dark_room_selfie (low-light), outdoor_nature_selfie (natural sunlight), outdoor_building_selfie (urban environments)
